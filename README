You need python (tested with 2.6+) and pygame installed.

Run ./trapped.py

Currently only the original roguelike keys are supported (jkyubn).  As the grid is hex, left-right movement isn't possible.
Walk into an oni to kill it; if it walks into you you die and the game terminates.  Ctrl+q quits the game.

Gameplay presently is quite pathetic, but it's a good (but slow) showcase of the FOV algorithm.
